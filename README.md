## Variables and Data Types

Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it. Here are some common data types:

```python
# integers
x = 5

# floating-point numbers
y = 3.14

# strings
message = "Hello, world!"

# boolean values
is_true = True
is_false = False

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to execute code only when certain conditions are met. Here's an example of an if statement:
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")
